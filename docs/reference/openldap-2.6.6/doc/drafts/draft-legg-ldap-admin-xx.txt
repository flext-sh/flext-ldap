Abstract

   This document adapts the X.500 directory REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative model for use
   by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  The REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative
   model partitions the Directory Information Tree for various aspects
   of directory data REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, e.g., subschema, access control and
   collective attributes.  The generic framework that applies to every
   aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration is described in this document.  The
   definitions that apply for a specific aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, e.g.,
   access control REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, are described in other documents.

1.  Introduction

   This document adapts the X.500 directory REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative model [X501]
   for use by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP].
   The REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative model partitions the Directory Information Tree
   (DIT) for various aspects of directory data REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, e.g.,
   subschema, access control and collective attributes.  This document
   provides the definitions for the generic parts of the REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative
   model that apply to every aspect of directory data REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration.

   Sections 3 to 7, in conjunction with [SUBENTRY], describe the means
   by which REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative authority is aportioned and exercised in the
   DIT.

   Aspects of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration that conform to the REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative model
   described in this document are detailed elsewhere, e.g., access
   control REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration is described in [ACA] and collective attribute
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration is described in [COLLECT].

   This document is derived from, and duplicates substantial portions
   of, Sections 4 and 8 of X.501 [X501].

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and  "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

INTERNET-DRAFT       Directory Administrative Model        June 16, 2004


   An REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area is a subtree of the DIT considered from the
   perspective of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration.  The root entry of the subtree is an
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point.  An REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point is represented by an
   entry holding an REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrativeRole attribute [SUBENTRY].  The values
   of this attribute identify the kind of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point.

4.  Autonomous Administrative Areas

   The DIT may be partitioned into one or more non-overlapping subtrees
   termed autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas.  It is expected that the
   entries in an autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area are all REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistered by
   the same REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative authority.

   An REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative authority may be responsible for several autonomous
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas in separated parts of the DIT but it SHOULD NOT
   arbitrarily partition the collection of entries under its control
   into autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas (thus creating adjacent
   autonomous areas REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistered by the same authority).

   The root entry of an autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area's subtree is
   called an autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point.  An autonomous
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area extends from its autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point
   downwards until another autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point is
   encountered, at which point another autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area
   begins.

5.  Specific Administrative Areas

   Entries in an REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area may be considered in terms of a
   specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative function.  When viewed in this context, an
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area is termed a specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area.

   Examples of specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas are subschema specific
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas, access control specific areas and collective
   attribute specific areas.

   An autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area may be considered as implicitly
   defining a single specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area for each specific
   aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration.  In this case, there is a precise
   correspondence between each such specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area and the
   autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area.

   Alternatively, for each specific aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, the
   autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area may be partitioned into
   non-overlapping specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas.

   If so partitioned for a particular aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, each
   entry of the autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area is contained in one and

INTERNET-DRAFT       Directory Administrative Model        June 16, 2004


   only one specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area for that aspect, i.e., specific
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas do not overlap.

   The root entry of a specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area's subtree is called
   a specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point.  A specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area
   extends from its specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point downwards until
   another specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point of the same REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative
   aspect is encountered, at which point another specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative
   area begins.  Specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas are always bounded by the
   autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area they partition.

   Where an autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area is not partitioned for a
   specific aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, the specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area
   for that aspect coincides with the autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area.
   In this case, the autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point is also the
   specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point for this aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration.  A
   particular REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point may be the root of an autonomous
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area and may be the root of one or more specific
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas for different aspects of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration.

   It is not necessary for an REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point to represent each
   specific aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative authority.  For example, there
   might be an REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point, subordinate to the root of the
   autonomous REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area, which is used for access control
   purposes only.

6.  Inner Administrative Areas

   For some aspects of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistration, e.g., access control or
   collective attributes, inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas may be defined
   within the specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas, to allow a limited form of
   delegation, or for REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative or operational convenience.

   An inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area may be nested within another inner
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area.  The rules for nested inner areas are defined as
   part of the definition of the specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative aspect for
   which they are allowed.

   The root entry of an inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area's subtree is called an
   inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point.  An inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area (within a
   specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area) extends from its inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative
   point downwards until a specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point of the same
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative aspect is encountered.  An inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area
   is bounded by the specific REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area within which it is
   defined.

7.  Administrative Entries

INTERNET-DRAFT       Directory Administrative Model        June 16, 2004


   An entry located at an REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative point is an REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative
   entry.  Administrative entries MAY have subentries [SUBENTRY] as
   immediate subordinates.  The REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative entry and its associated
   subentries are used to control the entries encompassed by the
   associated REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative area.  Where inner REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas are
   used, the scopes of these areas may overlap.  Therefore, for each
   specific aspect of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative authority, a definition is required
   of the method of combination of REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative information when it is
   possible for entries to be included in more than one subtree or
   subtree refinement associated with an inner area defined for that
   aspect.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a generic framework for employing policy of
   various kinds, e.g., access controls, to entries in the DIT.  Such
   policy can only be correctly enforced at a directory server holding a
   replica of a portion of the DIT if the REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative entries for
   REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative areas that overlap the portion of the DIT being
   replicated, and the subentries of those REDACTED_LDAP_BIND_PASSWORDistrative entries
   relevant to any aspect of policy that is required to be enforced at
   the replica, are included in the replicated information.

   Administrative entries and subentries SHOULD be protected from
   unauthorized examination or changes by appropriate access controls.
